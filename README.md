# Myntra Review Project

This project is a web scraping and analysis tool designed to collect, analyze, and visualize reviews from the Myntra platform. It leverages various Python libraries and frameworks to perform the following key functions:

- **Web Scraping**: Using `selenium` and `bs4` (BeautifulSoup) to gather product reviews from Myntra's website.
- **Data Analysis**: Processing and analyzing the collected review data using tools like `pandas` and `plotly`.
- **Visualization**: Presenting insights through interactive visualizations in a user-friendly format with `streamlit` and `plotly`.
- **Backend**: A Flask-based web server (using `flask-cors` and `gunicorn` for deployment) to manage API calls and serve results.
- **Environment Setup**: This project uses environment variables stored in `.env` files for configuration (`python-dotenv`).
